            This work is in the tradition of sound ethnography â€” an
            anthropological approach to soundscapes to explore how human culture
            is expressed and communicated through sound.

            At Hamline University, I engineered live sound for two sound
            installation events where visitors were presented with recordings
            from Hidden Falls Regional Park in St. Paul, MN, a place I took
            interest in for its soundscape's mixture of <i>natural</i> sounds
            and aircraft noise. In the second of these I was joined for an improvisational take on the soundscape by percussionists Matt Sumera and Josh Gumiela.
